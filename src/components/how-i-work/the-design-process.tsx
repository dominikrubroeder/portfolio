            Depending on the project requirements and needs, there are several
            steps to take in order to make a good, and fitting design to an
            upcoming project. You have to combine the project requirements with
            budget, creativity, management, design, development, engineering, IT
            and security; and especially, last but not least – the customer
            needs.
            <br />
            <br />
            Everyone is right for their perspective on the prioritization of the
            respective department. And everything has to be brought
            together–designed–into one final product or service.
            <br />
            <br />I discovered having a roadmap, especially when working in
            teams, brings transparency and structure into the workflow of
            design. It also makes it more easy to have an overview about open
            topics.

          The holy grail of Interface design is the result of having a flexible,
          fast adaptable design system in place. Good design is easy – and
          it&apos;s hard to achieve.

        <p>
          When it&apos;s the best point of starting development? As soon as
          possible. In order to make a full working and functional version, when
          the idea, the concept, the vision and the
          <span className="ml-1 line-through">first</span> thousand design
          iteration where ready, it&apos;s also ready and time to bring it to
          (technical) life – it needs to be tested and developed soonish.
          <br />
          <br /> This will catch up (hopefully rare) misleading thoughts in the
          Design Process and brings it to light, ready to be solved.
