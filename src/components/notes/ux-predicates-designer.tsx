        <li>
          <strong className="text-theme-contrary">Accessibility:</strong> Design

        <li>
          <strong className="text-theme-contrary">Efficiency:</strong> Design

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-theme-contrary">Aesthetics:</strong> While
          aesthetics are subjective, a visually appealing design can enhance the

        <li>
          <strong className="text-theme-contrary">Performance:</strong> Optimize
          for performance to minimize loading times and delays. A fast and
          responsive system contributes to a positive user experience.

          desktop), maintain consistency in design and functionality across all
          platforms.

        <li>

        By emphasizing these predicates, UX designers can contribute to creating
        a product that not only meets business goals but also delights and

        and a commitment to user-centric design principles are essential for
        success.
