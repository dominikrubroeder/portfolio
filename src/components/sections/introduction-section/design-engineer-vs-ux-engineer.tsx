              </span>
              Design Engineers primarily focus on the visual and interactive
              aspects of frontend development. They work closely with UI/UX
              designers to translate design mockups into functional and
              aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.

              Proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is essential for Design
              Engineers. They often have strong graphic design skills and are
              adept at using design tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or
              Sketch.

              Design Engineers are responsible for implementing the frontend
              components of a web application or website. They ensure that the
              design is faithfully translated into code and that the user
              interface functions correctly across different devices and
              browsers.

        <b className="text-theme-contrary">In summary</b>, while both Design
        Engineers and UX Engineers contribute to frontend development, Design
        Engineers focus more on the visual and interactive aspects of the user
        interface, while UX Engineers concentrate on optimizing the overall user
        experience through a combination of design and technical expertise. Both
        roles are essential for creating successful digital products and
        services that meet the needs and expectations of users.
