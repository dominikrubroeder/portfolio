          You don&apos;t have to &apos;draw&apos; – but fast sketching and
          scribble can improve visualize your ideas fast. I also had to learn
          this and get rid of &apos;Ahh, i don&apos;t need this&apos;

          Take notes. Just do it. It will help your brain organize the current
          task and summarize the outcome of your work while being in the
          process. You also will notice you will find more clarity and structure
          if you get stuck in a concept.
