      <p>Hey there,</p>

      <h3 className="font-bold text-foreground">
        My work is committed to the frontend. I like to create and build
        interfaces that are designed to be for a joyful web
        <span className="ml-1 font-normal text-muted-foreground">

        <p>
          As a UX Design Engineer, i am working for good user interfaces that
          transport emotion and do care about the impact of design. I want the
          user to enjoy their actions, feeling pleasant and delightful while
          scrolling through the page, pursuing his or her actions with joyful
          ease.
        </p>

        <p>
          With smooth animations and transitions that support the user&apos;s
          behaviour and provide guidance, the application should feel
          interactive, yet stable. Supporting the user to achieve their goals
          and intentions on the site seamlessly.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like to use psychological and design principles to build better and
          stable production applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think when the idea and the vision is clear, you can build the best
          product possible, with the right people, and the right technology.
