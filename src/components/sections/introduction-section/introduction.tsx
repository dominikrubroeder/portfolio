      <p>
        I am a Designer and a UX Engineer, working for good user interfaces that
        transport emotion and do care about the business impact of design, and
        the product. I want the user to enjoy their actions, feeling pleasant
        and delightful while scrolling through the page, pursuing his/ her
        actions with joyful ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        With smooth animations and transitions that support the user behaviour
        and provide guidance, the application should feel interactive, yet
        stable. Supporting the user to achieve their goals and intentions on the
        site seamlessly.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think that when the idea and the vision is clear, so the product can
        be, therefore fulfilling the business needs of the application.
