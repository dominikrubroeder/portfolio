      <p>
        I am a designer and a UX engineer, working for good user interfaces that
        transport emotion and do care about the business impact of design. I
        want the user to enjoy their actions, feeling pleasant and delightful
        while scrolling through the page, pursuing his or her actions with
        joyful ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        With smooth animations and transitions that support the users behaviour
        and provide guidance, the application should feel interactive, yet
        stable. Supporting the user to achieve their goals and intentions on the
        site seamlessly.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think that when the idea and the vision is clear, so the product can
        be, therefore fulfilling the user and business needs of the application.
