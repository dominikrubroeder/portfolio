      <p>
        I am a designer and a UX design engineer, working for good user
        interfaces that transport emotion and care about the impact of design. I
        want the user to enjoy their actions, feeling pleasant and delightful
        while scrolling through the page, pursuing his or her actions with
        joyful ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        With smooth animations and transitions that support the user&apos;s
        behaviour and provide guidance, the application should feel interactive,
        yet stable. Supporting the user to achieve their goals and intentions on
        the site seamlessly.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like to use psychological and design principles to build better
        production applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think when the idea and the vision is clear, you can build the best
        product possible, with the right people, and the right technology.
