        I am a Designer and a UX Engineer, working for good user interfaces that
        transport emotion and does care about the business impact of design, and
        the product. I want the user to enjoy their actions, feeling pleasent
        and delightful while scrolling through the page, pursuing his/ her
        actions with ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        With smooth animations and transitions that support the user behaviour
        and provide guidance, the application should feel interactive, yet
        stable. Supporting the user to achieve their goals and intentions on the
        site.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think that when the idea and the vision is clear, so can the product
        be, therefore fulfilling the business needs of the application with
        care.
