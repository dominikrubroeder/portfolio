        My work is committed to the frontend. I like to create and build

          <p>
            As a UX Design Engineer, i am working for good user interfaces that
            transport emotion and do care about the impact of design. I want the
            user to enjoy their actions, feeling pleasant and delightful while
            scrolling through the page, pursuing his or her actions with joyful
            ease.
          </p>

          <p>
            With smooth animations and transitions that support the user&apos;s
            behaviour and provide guidance, the application should feel
            interactive, yet stable. Supporting the user to achieve their goals
            and intentions on the site seamlessly.
          </p>

          <p>
            I like to use psychological and design principles to build better
            and stable production applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think when the idea and the vision is clear, you can build the
            best product possible, with the right people, and the right
            technology.
